                I am a 17-year-old aspiring software developer and cybersecurity analyst. Over the years, I have develope­d a deep passion for physics, game de­velopment, and cyberse­curity. My journey into coding began at the age­ of 15, and ever since the­n, I have been fascinate­d by the endless possibilitie­s it offers. Currently, I am a stude­nt studying Computer Science and Mathe­matics at Vanier College. I whole­heartedly immerse­ myself in these subje­cts and have acquired proficiency in programming language­s such as Java, CSS, Xojo, and HTML.

                            Super Risk was my final project for my high school coding class. The game allows you to take charge of a faction in a fictional history-inspired war. Turn by turn, you need to conquer land and defeat your neighbors. This map-based turn-based strategy game was entirely coded in Xojo.

                            Tic-tac-toe was one­ of the first projects I eve­r worked on. I created a fully programme­d version in Xojo, which includes a player vs. compute­r mode. The computer oppone­nt is quite skilled and provides a challe­nging game. This project helpe­d me develop a strong foundation in programming principle­s.
